**The list was updated in {{'now' | date: "%Y"}}.**

Everyone knows Spring and Hibernate, but there are other libraries and frameworks that are worth your attention. I pulled a list of **{{site.data.java_libraries.size}} Java libraries** that I like and use daily. Some of them are well-known; others are not so popular, yet very useful at work.
