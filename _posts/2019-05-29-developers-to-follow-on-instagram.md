Instagram is becoming the next big thing in education. In addition to [books](/2019/03/17/the-best-books-all-software-developers-must-read/), [conferences](/2019/03/21/the-best-developer-conferences/) and [Twitter](/2019/05/25/developers-to-follow-on-twitter/), I use Instagram to get access to the content you won't find anywhere else on the internet. The content is a mix of coding tips, good advice and inspiring visuals. If you appreciate good photography and aesthetics, check out a list of **{{site.data.instagram.accounts.size}} high-quality Instagram accounts that I follow**:
