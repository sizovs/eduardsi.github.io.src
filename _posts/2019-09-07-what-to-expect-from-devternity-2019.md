**[DevTernity](https://devternity.com)** conference is growing in popularity, hitting the charts and attracting hundreds of engineers not only from Europe, but also from the USA, Canada, Asia, and even Iceland. What can you expect from DevTernity this year?

## Whom DevTernity 2019 is intended for?

Technology change like the weather, making it hard to keep up with trends. To make good use of your time, it's important to rise above the hype and invest time in developing long-living, practical skills.

DevTernity focuses on sane software architecture, coding, and leadership skills. No vendor-specific and marketing bullshit allowed.

**If you want to build software that makes you proud and your customers happy, then DevTernity is your home.**

Scott knows the answer.

## Power Workshops
The second day is devoted to full-day workshops. This year, you can choose from seven workshops:

![Speaker](https://devternity.com/images/jb_vec.png)
**{ 1/7 } J.B. Rainsberger · Surviving Legacy Code**

In this workshop, you'll learn how to deal with legacy code – meaningful profitable code that we're afraid to change. You will work on a diabolical-but-fun code base and practice a handful of refactoring and testing exercises that develop the most essential legacy code rescue skills and disciplines.

**{ 3/7 } Uwe Friedrichsen ·  Software Architecture in a Post-agile World**

In this workshop you'll discover why we need architectural work, and learn a surprisingly simple down-to-earth approach for implementing it. After this workshop, you will have a better understanding what architectural work actually is about, what is important, what is not, and how to tackle it in practice.

![Speaker](https://devternity.com/images/ianco.png)

![Speaker](https://devternity.com/images/vec_kevlin.png)
**{ 5/7 } Kevlin Henney · Good Code**

This workshop explores what properties we want from a codebase and, therefore, what we can deduce to be good. This session will explore some common guidelines on what is considered good, from expression to subsystem, from naming to tests, from fluent to SOLID.

![Speaker](https://devternity.com/images/max_vec.png)
**{ 6/7 } Maxim Dorofeev · Jedi Techniques of Personal Effectiveness**

This practical workshop will equip you with necessary skills for accomplishing more, with less stress and efforts, and bring you closer to the work-life balance on a win-win basis. After the training, you will know how to achieve more at work and personal life simultaneously (instead of conventional view: “one at the expense of another”).

![Speaker](https://devternity.com/images/jimbo.png)
**{ 7/7 } Jimmy Bogard · SOA Done Right**

During this workshop you'll build a solid foundation of theory and practice on SOA development. You'll understand service oriented architecture concepts, and DDD concepts such as bounded contexts and data ownership and apply those concepts to build a simple, yet fully functional, sample app with a microservices architecture.
