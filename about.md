My name is Eduards Sizovs  /É›dwÉ™rd sÉªzov/. I am a professional software developer, trainer, speaker, and conference organizer. I am {{age}} years old.

Iâ€™ve been involved in software development for over 15 years as a developer, architect, engineering manager, CTO, advisor, and development coach. Today, **[through The Principal Dev masterclass](https://principal.dev)** I help developers become architects and engineering leaders and teach them how to deliver value sooner, improve teamwork, dev process, and hiring results. 


Before, I built from scratch and led for 7 years the most-waited software development conference in Europe, that featured the legends of software development such as **Robert Martin, Scott Hanselman, Kevlin Henney, Sandro Mancuso, J.B. Rainsberger, Allen Holub, Venkat Subramaniam, Dave Farley.**

I personally spoke at 103 events Worldwide, including conferences with 1000+ attendees. You can see me in action:

From time to time I contribute to open-source. I built a number of OSS projects such as [dev.events](https://dev.events), [PipelinR](https://github.com/sizovs/pipelinr), [mustread.tech](https://mustread.tech), and [dev.tube](https://dev.tube). Some of them have become quite popular, others are discontinued.

I'm also a certified Enterprise Architect (OCEA), CSM, CSPO, PMP, and an ICF coach. I also hold a CS degree in programming and engineering management. But it doesn't really matter anyway.
