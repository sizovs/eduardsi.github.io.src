Iâ€™ve been involved in enterprise software development for over 15 years as a developer, architect, CTO, IT director, and independent consultant. Today, through training and mentoring I help teams establish good coding culture, accelerate development process, and improve hiring process. 

I lead **[DevTernity](https://devternity.com)** conference, where we turn developers into architects and engineering leaders. It has been recognized as one of **[the best developer conferences in Europe](https://itconference.top)**.

I personally spoke at 103 events Worldwide, including conferences with 1000+ attendees. You can see me in action:

I organize certification training and masterclasses for software engineers called **[The Principal Developer](https://principal.dev)**.

Attendees say that my training is always practical, inspiring, and high-energy. You can hire me to run a training for your team.

When I have time, I contribute to open-source. I built a number of OSS projects such as [dev.events](https://dev.events), [PipelinR](https://github.com/sizovs/pipelinr), and [dev.tube](https://dev.tube). Some of them have become quite popular.

I'm a certified Enterprise Architect (OCMEA), Certified Scrum Master, Certified Product Owner, Certified Project Management Professional (PMP), and an ICF certified coach. I also hold a degree in Computer Science (programming and software architecture). But it doesn't really matter anyway.
